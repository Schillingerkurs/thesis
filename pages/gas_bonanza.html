<h1>The Mozambican Gas Bonanza and Its Economic Effects</h1>
<p>This section provides compares the economic activity across Mozambique over time. The left map plots the exploration wheels, discovered gas fields and registered companies
at the district level (adm2)  in 2008, prior to the discovery of the Windjammer gas field.
The figures also show the location of exploration drilling wells, as documented by the <a href="https://www.inp.gov.mz/en">National Institute for Petroleum</a>, and actual giant or super giant discoveries <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MEH5CS">by Cust, Mihalyi, and Rivera-Ballesteros</a>. The location of private companies is defined based on their headquarters location documented in the Boletim da Republica, Serie III (Bd3).</p>
<p>Two trends are remarkable. First, substantial exploration activities were carried out all over Mozambique, making it almost impossible to predict the discovery of the Windjammer field in 2009. Second, economic activities remain highly centralized in Maputo and the larger cities. Only a few companies registered their headquarters in rural areas, not even near the giant gas fields. For instance, satellite images (the legend icon at the top right corner of the map includes the current Esri images) show a major FDI project in the district of Palma, near the Areas 4 LNG. However, these projects operate under special legal status and have very little relation to local economic activities. Only three private companies have their headquarters in this district.</p>

<h1>Mapping PEPs over time</h1>
<p>A PEP, which stands for Politically Exposed Person, is an individual who holds an important role in the government or public sector. They play a significant role in the regulations of the financial sector. Banks are required to identify PEP customers because they have a higher risk of being involved in bribery and corruption due to their positions. This knowledge helps banks comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations by implementing stricter due diligence measures.</p>
<p>However, despite the importance of PEPs, there is no universally accepted international definition of a PEP. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) defines them as people in high-ranking government positions or key political party members and their close relatives. In my dissertation, I study the behavior of Mozambican PEPs in the private sector over time. This introduces additional challenges: we need to define not only who is considered a PEP, but also when they start and end their political careers. The definition of the starting point is straightforward: it is the year of nomination or election to a mandate. I observe the announcement of such events based on data from news archives in Mozambique and Europe. Observing the end point of a mandate is more tricky. Politicians can resign or die at any time, and the name or definition of a political mandate might change over time. Given these constraints, I assume that a mandate ends if the person is no longer mentioned during the announcement of a new legislation. I divide the nineteen years between 1975, the year of independence, and 1994, the first year of the multiparty system in Mozambique, by one cut-off point: the death of then-president Samora Machel in 1986. To make things even more complicated, the independence movement FRELIMO announced their first ministers in 1969, six years before the independence of Mozambique.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the only public database that covers PEP data over time is the <a href="https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/whogov-dataset/%22">Who Governs dataset</a> by Jacob Nyrup and Stuart Bramwell, who parsed the annual CIA Yearbook to identify PEPs over time. To compare and validate this data, I compare the mandates of the Who Governs data with the ones I identified in the news archives. In the figure below:</p>

## Why do Peps matter?

A Pep, short for Politically Exposed Persons, is an individuals who has an important role in the government or public sector. They lay an important role in the many regularities of the financial sector.

Banks must identify PEP customers because they have a higher risk of being involved in bribery and corruption due to their positions. This knowledge helps banks follow anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations by implementing stricter due diligence measures.

However, even though PEPs are really important there's no universally accepted international definition of a PEP. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) defines them as people in high-ranking government positions or key political party members and their close relatives.

In my dissertation, I study the behavior of Mozambican PEPs in the private sector over time.

This introduces additional challenges: We need to define not only who is a PEP, but also when they start and stopped their political career.

The definition of the starting point is straight forward: The year of the nomination or election of a mandate.

 I observe the annocument of such such events based on data from  news archives in Mozambique and Europe.

  Observing the end point of a mandate is more tricky. Politicians can resign or die at any time.

    Additionally, the name or definition of aolitical mandate might change over time. Given these constrains I assume that mandate ends,

    if the person is no longer mentioned during the announcement of a new legislation. In divide the ninteen years between 1975, the year of independence, and 1994, the first year of the multiparty system in Mozambique,

    by one  cut-off point: The death of then president, Samora Machel in 1986. To make things even more complicated the independence movement FRELIMO announced their first ministers in 1969, six years before the independence of Mozambique.

    No my knowledge, the only public database  that covers PEP data over time is the[ahref=&#34;https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/whogov-dataset/&#34;](ahref=%22https://politicscentre.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/whogov-dataset/%22)Who Governs dataset `</a>` by Jacob Nyrup and Stuart Bramwell, who parsed the annual CIA Yearbook to identify PEPs over time.

    To compare and validate this data, I compare the mandates of the Who Governs data with the ones I identified in the news archives. In the figure below.





Defining Peps and fuzzy string matching might not sound like not the most exciting topic. But if we want to understand how links between politics and business shape the world we live in, we need understand how the sausage is made that allows one to study links political- and economic power on an individual level.


The next challenge is to define the link between PEPs and private companies.I use the ()[https://www.portaldogoverno.gov.mz/por/Governo/Legislacao/Boletins-da-Republica](ahref=%22https://www.portaldogoverno.gov.mz/por/Governo/Legislacao/Boletins-da-Republica%22))[Boletim da Republica, Serie III (Bd3)) to identify the board members of private companies and associations.]

    But names are not consistently spelled across every dataset. Middle names are often missing and the order of first and last names is not consistent.

    Each chapter in my dissertation explains in details, how I link names across datasets. This section provides an overview how different data set match to each other and includes additional datasources

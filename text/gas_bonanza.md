# The mozambican gas bonanza and its economic effects
The following section provides an overview of the countries gas bonanza on a macro level. It presents the economic activity at the district level (adm2) in Mozambique in 2008, right before the discovery of the Windjammer gas field, and in 2020.
The figures also show the location of exploration drilling wheels, as documented  by the [National Institute for Petroleum](https://www.inp.gov.mz/en), and actual giant or super giant as discoveries [by Cust,Mihalyi and Rivera-Ballesteros](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MEH5CS). To compare of social and economic activity across districts, the interactive maps below lists population density, Travel time to capital (h) (as recorded in the [State reach project](https://www.carlmueller-crepon.org/project/statecap_data/) by MÃ¼ller-Crepon (which is available until 2017)) and number of registered private companies per year. I define the location of private companies based on their Headquarter location documented in the Boletim da Republica, Serie III (Bd3).

Two trends are remarkable. First, substantial exploration activities where carried out all over Mozambique, which made it almost impossible to predict discovery of the Windjammer field in 2009. Second, the economic activities remains highly centralized in Maputo and the larger cities. Only a few companies registered their Headquarter in rual areas, not even nearby giant gas fields. For instance, satellite images (the legend icon at top right corner of the map include the current Esri images ) show a major FDI project in the district of Palma, nearby the Areas 4 LNG. However, these project operate special legal status and relate very little to local economic activities. Tree private companies have their HQ in this district.

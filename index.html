            <h1>The mozambican gas bonanza and its economic effects</h1>
            <p> 
                Chapter One and Two in my dissertation examine business and politics ties on an individual level in Mozambique The following section provides an overview of the countries gas bonanza on a macro level. 
                It presents the economic activity at the district level (adm2) in Mozambique in 2008, right before the discovery of the Windjammer gas field, and in 2020.

                The figures also show the location of exploration drilling wheels (as recorded by the  <a href="https://www.inp.gov.mz/en">National Institute for Petroleum</a>) and actual giant or super giant as discoveries (as recorded in the <cite><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MEH5CS">Giant oil and gas field discoveries</a></cite> by Cust,Mihalyi and Rivera-Ballesteros) in Mozambique.
            
                As compare of social and economic activity across districts, I use population density, Travel time to capital (h) (as recorded in the <cite><a href="https://www.carlmueller-crepon.org/project/statecap_data/"> State reach project</a></cite> by MÃ¼ller-Crepon (which is available until 2017))
                and number of registered private companies per year. I define the location of private companies based on their Headquarter location documented in the <a href="https://www.portaldogoverno.gov.mz/por/Governo/Legislacao/Boletins-da-Republica">Boletim da Republica, Serie III (Bd3)</a>
                
             <p>
                Two trends are remarkable. First, substantial exploration activities where carried out all over Mozambique, which made it almost impossible to predict discovery of the Windjammer field in 2009. Second, the economic activities remains highly centralized in Maputo and the larger cities. Only a few companies registered their Headquarter in rual areas, not even nearby giant gas fields.
                That does not mean there is no economic activities in rural areas, but most of them are either informal or registered in the capital.
                
                For instance, satellite images (the legend icon at top right corner of the map include the current Esri images ) show a major FDI project in the district of Palma, nearby the Areas 4 LNG. However, these project operate special legal status and relate very little to local economic activities. Tree private companies have their HQ in this district.

            <h1>How many PEPs</h1>
            <p>
                PEPs, short for Politically Exposed Persons, are individuals who play significant roles in the government or public sector. Banks must identify PEP customers because they have a higher risk of being involved in bribery and corruption due to their positions. This knowledge helps banks follow anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations by implementing stricter due diligence measures. However, there's no universally accepted international definition of a PEP. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) defines them as people in high-ranking government positions or key political party members and their close relatives.
            </p> 
                In my dissertation's first and second chapters, I study the behavior of Mozambican PEPs in the private sector. This research raises the question of who should be included in such studies. Nowadays, various entities maintain databases of PEPs, so which one should you trust? How do these databases differ from each other? The following figure provides an overview of the available measures and offers a comparison.

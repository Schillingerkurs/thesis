            <h1>How many PEPs</h1>
            <p>
                PEPs, short for Politically Exposed Persons, are individuals who play significant roles in the government or public sector. Banks must identify PEP customers because they have a higher risk of being involved in bribery and corruption due to their positions. This knowledge helps banks follow anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations by implementing stricter due diligence measures. However, there's no universally accepted international definition of a PEP. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) defines them as people in high-ranking government positions or key political party members and their close relatives.
            </p> 
                In my dissertation's first and second chapters, I study the behavior of Mozambican PEPs in the private sector. This research raises the question of who should be included in such studies. Nowadays, various entities maintain databases of PEPs, so which one should you trust? How do these databases differ from each other? The following figure provides an overview of the available measures and offers a comparison.

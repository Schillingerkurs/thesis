            <h1>The mozambican Gas Bonanza and its economic effects</h1>
            <p> 
                Chapter One and Two in my dissertation examine business and politics ties on an individual level. The following section provides an overview of the Mozambican gas bonanza on a macro level. 
                It presents the economic activity at the district level (adm2) in Mozambique in 2008, right before the discovery of the Windjammer gas field, and in 2020.

                The figures also show the location of explorative drilling wheels (as recorded by the  <a href="https://www.inp.gov.mz/en">National Institute for Petroleum</a>) and actual giant or super giant as discoveries (as recorded in the <cite><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MEH5CS">Giant oil and gas field discoveries</a></cite> by Cust,Mihalyi and Rivera-Ballesteros) in Mozambique.
                
                The left maps values for 2008, one year before the discovery of the Windjammer gas field, the right map shows values for 2020.
                
                As measures of social and economic activity, I use Population density, Travel time to capital (h) (as recorded in the <cite><a href="https://www.carlmueller-crepon.org/project/statecap_data/"> State reach project</a></cite> by MÃ¼ller-Crepon (which is available until 2017))
                and number of registered private companies of each district per year.
             <p>
                The left maps values for 2008, one year before the discovery of the Windjammer gas field, the right map shows values for 2020.
             <p>
                The big trends are remarkable. First, substantial explorative activities where carried out all over Mozambique, which made it almost impossible to predict discovery of the Windjammer field in 2009. Second, the economic activities remains highly centralized in Maputo and the larger cities. Only a few companies registered their Headquarter in rual areas, not even nearby giant gas fields.
                This suggested limited economic development in the rural areas.

            <h1>How many PEPs</h1>
            <p>
                PEPs, short for Politically Exposed Persons, are individuals who play significant roles in the government or public sector. Banks must identify PEP customers because they have a higher risk of being involved in bribery and corruption due to their positions. This knowledge helps banks follow anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations by implementing stricter due diligence measures. However, there's no universally accepted international definition of a PEP. The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) defines them as people in high-ranking government positions or key political party members and their close relatives.
            </p> 
                In my dissertation's first and second chapters, I study the behavior of Mozambican PEPs in the private sector. This research raises the question of who should be included in such studies. Nowadays, various entities maintain databases of PEPs, so which one should you trust? How do these databases differ from each other? The following figure provides an overview of the available measures and offers a comparison.
